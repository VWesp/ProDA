Building DAG of jobs...
Using shell: /bin/bash
Provided cores: 10
Rules claiming more threads will be scaled down.
Job counts:
	count	jobs
	1	Visualize_Discarded_Results
	1	Visualize_Retained_Results
	1	finish
	3

rule Visualize_Retained_Results:
    input: results/retained/proda.tsv
    output: retained_finished.txt
    jobid: 1
    threads: 10

Terminating processes on user request, this might take some time.
Removing output files of failed job Visualize_Retained_Results since they might be corrupted:
retained_finished.txt
